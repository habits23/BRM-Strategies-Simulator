    ## A User's Guide to the Poker Bankroll Simulator

    Welcome! This tool is designed to help you test different bankroll management (BRM) strategies to see how they might perform over hundreds of thousands of hands. It's not a crystal ball, but by running thousands of simulations, it can give you powerful insights into the risks and rewards of your chosen approach.

    This guide will walk you through every setting and show you how to make sense of the results.

    ### Section 1: The Control Panel (Sidebar)

    This is where you set the core parameters for the simulation.

    #### General Settings
    *   **Starting Bankroll**: How much money you're starting with.
    *   **Target Bankroll**: Your goal. The simulation will tell you the probability of hitting this target.
    *   **Ruin Threshold**: Your "game over" point. If a simulated version of you drops to this amount, that run stops.
    *   **Number of Simulations**: How many "alternate realities" to run. More is better (2,000+ is recommended for accurate results), but it takes longer. Think of it as running the same experiment thousands of times to get a reliable average.
    *   **Total Hands to Simulate**: The time horizon for each simulation. How many hands will each "alternate you" play? 50,000 is a good starting point.

    #### Gameplay & Rakeback Settings
    *   **Hands per Bankroll Check**: How often the simulation checks your bankroll to decide if you should move up or down in stakes. 1,000 hands is a common choice.
    *   **Rakeback (%)**: The percentage of rake you get back. This is a critical, variance-free boost to your win rate. Setting it to 0% can make aggressive strategies unprofitable and significantly increase your Risk of Ruin.
    *   **Enable Stop-Loss**: If enabled, simulations will 'sit out' for the next hand block (defined by 'Hands per Bankroll Check') after losing more than the specified amount in a single block. This simulates taking a break after a big losing session.

    #### Advanced Statistical Settings
    This is the "secret sauce" of the simulator that makes it more realistic than a simple variance calculator.

    *   **Prior Sample Size**: This setting controls the model's **uncertainty** about your true skill level. It's a subtle but powerful concept.
        *   **Analogy**: Think of your `Sample Hands` as a single poll you conducted. The `Prior Sample Size` is like a large collection of historical data from a professional polling firm. The simulation combines both to make a final prediction.
        *   **Low Prior (e.g., 5,000)**: The total "pool of evidence" (your hands + the prior) is small. This makes the model **uncertain**, so it creates a *wide* range of long-term luck outcomes (`Assigned WR`s) to reflect that uncertainty.
        *   **High Prior (e.g., 50,000)**: The total "pool of evidence" is large. This makes the model very **certain**, so it creates a *narrow* range of long-term luck outcomes. The `Assigned WR`s will be very consistent across simulations.
        *   **In short**: To get a wider, more "lucky" distribution of outcomes, use a lower prior. To get a more consistent, less "lucky" distribution, use a higher prior.
    *   **Weight for 0-Hand Stake Estimates**: For stakes you've never played, this slider balances your own guess (1.0) vs. the model's guess based on the stakes below it (0.0). A value of 0.5 is a good middle ground.

    #### Plotting & Display Settings
    *   **Distribution Plot Percentile Range**: Controls the 'zoom' on the Final Bankroll Distribution comparison plot. A value of 99 shows the 1st to 99th percentile of outcomes. A value of 95 shows the 5th to 95th, zooming in more on the central results.

    #### Model Validation
    *   **Load Sanity Check Config**: This is an advanced feature for validating the simulation engine. It loads a simple, single-stake scenario that can be compared against standard variance calculator results to confirm the core math is sound. This will overwrite your current settings.

    #### Other Settings
    *   **Random Seed**: This is like the specific shuffle of a deck of cards. Using the same seed will always give you the exact same results. Change the seed (or click the ðŸŽ² button) to get a different "shuffle" and a new set of random outcomes.
    *   **Save & Load Configuration**: Use these buttons to save all your settings to a file and load them back later. Very useful!

    ### Section 2: Your Data & Strategies (Main Tabs)

    #### Tab 1: Stakes Data
    This is where you tell the simulator about your performance.

    *   **`EV Win Rate (bb/100)`**: **This is the most important input for the simulation!** Use your "All-in Adj bb/100" from your poker tracker. This is the best measure of your true skill and is used for all core calculations.
    *   **`Std Dev (bb/100)`**: Your standard deviation. This measures how "swingy" your results are. You can find this in your tracker. 80-120 is typical for No-Limit Hold'em.
    *   **`Sample Hands`**: How many hands of data you have for this stake. This is crucial! A large sample tells the model to be confident in your EV Win Rate. A small sample tells the model that your true win rate is uncertain, so it will simulate a wider range of possibilities (the "luck" factor).
    *   **`Win Rate Drop`**: The estimated change in your win rate (in bb/100) when moving up from the *previous* stake. Use a positive value for a drop (e.g., 1.5) and a negative value for an expected increase (e.g., -1.0). The lowest stake should have a value of 0.
    *   **`Rake (bb/100)`**: How much rake you pay at this stake. Used to calculate your rakeback profit.
    *   **Save and Sort Stakes Button**: **Always click this after making changes!** This is required for the Hysteresis (Sticky) strategy to function correctly.

    #### Tab 2: Bankroll Management Strategies
    Here you define the rules for moving up and down stakes.

    *   **Standard Strategy**:
        *   You set bankroll `thresholds`. When your bankroll is above a threshold, the corresponding rule applies.
        *   The `table mix` tells the simulator what games to play. You can use:
            *   **Fixed Ratios**: `NL20: 1`, `NL50: 3` means you play 25% of your tables at NL20 and 75% at NL50.
            *   **Percentages**: `NL100: "100%"` means you play only NL100.
            *   **Percentage Ranges**: `NL200: "20-40%"` models uncertainty in your game selection.
    *   **Hysteresis (Sticky) Strategy**:
        *   This is a "move up fast, move down slow" strategy designed to prevent you from dropping stakes during small downswings. You can set a single buy-in buffer for all stakes or check the **"Use per-stake buy-in buffers"** box to define a unique buffer for each stake individually.
        *   **Moving Up**: You move up to a new stake (e.g., NL50) only when you have enough buy-ins for it (e.g., 40 BIs for NL50).
        *   **Moving Down (The "Sticky" Part)**: Once you're playing NL50, you *only* move back down to NL20 if your bankroll drops below the requirement for NL20 (e.g., 40 BIs for NL20). This creates a "buffer zone" where you stick to the higher stake.

    ---

    ### Section 3: Interpreting the Results

    This is where you see the outcome of thousands of possible poker careers.

    #### Automated Strategy Analysis
    *   This is the first section you'll see in the results. It's an AI-generated summary that gives you plain-English insights into your strategies. It will tell you which strategy was the safest, which had the most upside, and why one might have performed better than another. This analysis is also included in the PDF report.

    #### Strategy Comparison
    *   **Summary Table**: A quick overview of the most important metrics.
        *   **Median Final BR**: The 50th percentile outcome. Half the time you do better, half the time you do worse. It's a good measure of the "typical" result.
        *   **Mode Final BR**: The most frequently occurring final bankroll outcome.
        *   **Median Growth**: The median percentage growth from the starting bankroll.
        *   **Median Hands Played**: The median number of hands played per simulation. This can be lower than the total if a stop-loss is frequently triggered.
        *   **Median Profit (Play)**: The median profit from gameplay only, excluding rakeback.
        *   **Median Rakeback**: The median rakeback earned. Compare this to "Median Profit (Play)" to see how much your strategy relies on rakeback.
        *   **Risk of Ruin (RoR)**: Your chance of going broke according to your ruin threshold. A critical risk metric.
        *   **Target Prob**: Your chance of hitting your goal.
        *   **5th %ile BR**: The 5th percentile final bankroll. 95% of simulations ended with a bankroll higher than this value.
        *   **P95 Max Downswing**: A measure of a "worst-case" downswing. 5% of the time, you will have a downswing even bigger than this number.
    *   **Comparison Plots**:
        *   **Median Bankroll Progression**: Shows the typical journey of your bankroll over time for each strategy.
        *   **Final Bankroll Distribution**: A key plot. A tall, narrow peak means a strategy is very consistent. A short, wide curve means the strategy has a wider range of outcomes (higher risk/reward).
        *   **Psychological Cost: Time Spent Below Bankroll Peak**: A bar chart showing the median percentage of hands a strategy spends 'underwater'. A lower percentage indicates a smoother, less stressful journey.
        *   **Risk vs. Reward Analysis**: A scatter plot showing the trade-off between risk (X-axis) and reward (Y-axis). The ideal strategy is in the top-left corner (low risk, high reward).

    #### Detailed Analysis (Per Strategy)
    This section gives you a deep dive into each strategy.

    *   **Visuals**:
        *   **Bankroll Progression**: Shows the median path (blue line), the 25th-75th percentile range (shaded area), and 50 random individual simulations (grey lines) to give you a feel for the variance.
        *   **Distribution of Assigned Luck (WR)**: This chart visualizes the "luck" factor. It shows the range of "true skill + long-term luck" the simulation assigns to different runs. The width of this curve is determined by your `Sample Hands` inputâ€”less data means more uncertainty and a wider curve.
        *   **Maximum Downswing Distribution**: Shows the full range of potential downswings. Helps you mentally prepare for the worst!
    *   **Key Insights**:
        *   **Hands Distribution**: Shows where you'll spend most of your time. For each stake, it provides:
            *   **Percentage**: The share of total hands played at this stake across all simulations.
            *   **Avg. WR**: The average win rate the simulation used for this stake. This includes the "luck" factor, so it will differ slightly from your input. It represents the average "true skill" assigned to players at this stake.
            *   **Trust**: A percentage showing how much the model "trusts" your input EV Win Rate. It's calculated based on your `Sample Hands` versus the `Prior Sample Size`. A high trust percentage means the model is confident in your data and will apply less long-term luck (variance) to your win rate. A low trust percentage means the model is uncertain and will simulate a wider range of good and bad luck.
        *   **Median Hands Played**: The median number of hands played per simulation. This can be lower than the total if a stop-loss is frequently triggered.
        *   **Median Stop-Losses**: If enabled, this metric shows the typical number of times a stop-loss was triggered during a simulation run. It's a good indicator of session volatility.
        *   **Risk of Demotion**: The chance you'll have to move down after successfully moving up to a stake.
    *   **Percentile Win Rate Analysis**: This section is crucial for understanding *why* some runs did well and others did poorly. It shows a five-number summary (5th, 25th, Median, 75th, 95th) of outcomes, giving you a detailed look at the full spectrum of possibilities.
        *   **5th Percentile**: A typical "bad run" or unlucky outcome.
        *   **25th Percentile**: A "mildly bad" run. Not a disaster, but a common losing scenario.
        *   **Median (50th)**: The outcome for the run that finished with the median final bankroll.
        *   **75th Percentile**: A "mildly good" run. A common winning scenario.
        *   **95th Percentile**: A typical "good run" or heater.
    *   For each percentile, you'll see these metrics:
        *   **Assigned WR**: The "true" win rate (skill + long-term luck) the simulator assigned to the entire run. A high number here means this simulated "you" was on a long-term heater.
            It is influenced by:
            *   **`EV Win Rate (bb/100)`**: Your stated skill level, which is the starting point.
            *   **`Sample Hands`**: The more hands you have, the more the model trusts your EV Win Rate, and the smaller the "luck" adjustment will be.
            *   **`Std Dev (bb/100)`**: Higher volatility means more uncertainty, which allows for a wider range of possible long-term luck adjustments.
            *   **`Prior Sample Size`**: The model's "skepticism." A high value here makes the model more skeptical of small samples, leading to a wider luck distribution.
        *   **Play WR**: This is the actual, realized win rate from playing the hands. It's the final result after all the session-to-session variance is accounted for. It's calculated by taking the `Assigned WR` and adding random variance for every block of hands played.
            It is influenced by:
            *   **`Assigned WR`**: The baseline skill + long-term luck for the run.
            *   **`Std Dev (bb/100)`**: Directly determines the magnitude of the upswings and downswings in each session.
            *   **`Hands per Bankroll Check`**: The length of the "session" being simulated.
        *   **Rakeback WR**: The extra win rate you got from rakeback.
