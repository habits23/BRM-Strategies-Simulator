    ## A User's Guide to the Poker Bankroll Simulator

    Welcome! This tool is designed to help you test different bankroll management (BRM) strategies to see how they might perform over hundreds of thousands of hands. It's not a crystal ball, but by running thousands of simulations, it can give you powerful insights into the risks and rewards of your chosen approach.

    This guide will walk you through every setting and show you how to make sense of the results.

    ### Section 1: The Control Panel (Sidebar)

    This is where you set the core parameters for the simulation.

    #### General Settings
    *   **Starting Bankroll**: How much money you're starting with.
    *   **Target Bankroll**: Your goal. The simulation will tell you the probability of hitting this target.
    *   **Ruin Threshold**: Your "game over" point. If a simulated version of you drops to this amount, that run stops.
    *   **Number of Simulations**: How many "alternate realities" to run. More is better (2,000+ is recommended for accurate results), but it takes longer. Think of it as running the same experiment thousands of times to get a reliable average.
    *   **Total Hands to Simulate**: The time horizon for each simulation. How many hands will each "alternate you" play? 50,000 is a good starting point.

    #### Gameplay & Rakeback Settings
    *   **Hands per Bankroll Check**: How often the simulation checks your bankroll to decide if you should move up or down in stakes. 1,000 hands is a common choice.
    *   **Rakeback (%)**: The percentage of rake you get back. This is free money that gets added to your bankroll during the simulation.

    #### Advanced Statistical Settings
    This is the "secret sauce" of the simulator that makes it more realistic than a simple variance calculator.

    *   **Prior Sample Size**: This tells the model how much to trust your win rate data. Think of it as the model's "skepticism." A high value means the model is more skeptical of small sample sizes and will introduce more long-term "luck" (good and bad) into the simulation.
        *   **Example**: If this is set to 50,000 and you provide a stake with a 5,000 hand sample, the model thinks, "This could just be a lucky streak," and will simulate futures where your true win rate is both higher and lower than what you've observed.
    *   **Weight for 0-Hand Stake Estimates**: For stakes you've never played, this slider balances your own guess (1.0) vs. the model's guess based on the stakes below it (0.0). A value of 0.5 is a good middle ground.

    #### Other Settings
    *   **Random Seed**: This is like the specific shuffle of a deck of cards. Using the same seed will always give you the exact same results. Change the seed (or click the ðŸŽ² button) to get a different "shuffle" and a new set of random outcomes.
    *   **Save & Load Configuration**: Use these buttons to save all your settings to a file and load them back later. Very useful!

    ---

    ### Section 2: Your Data & Strategies (Main Tabs)

    #### Tab 1: Stakes Data
    This is where you tell the simulator about your performance.

    *   **`EV Win Rate (bb/100)`**: **This is the most important number!** Use your "All-in Adj bb/100" from your poker tracker (like PokerTracker 4 or Hand2Note). This is the best measure of your true skill.
    *   **`Std Dev (bb/100)`**: Your standard deviation. This measures how "swingy" your results are. You can find this in your tracker. 80-120 is typical for No-Limit Hold'em.
    *   **`Sample Hands`**: How many hands of data you have for this stake. This is crucial! A large sample tells the model to be confident in your EV Win Rate. A small sample tells the model that your true win rate is uncertain, so it will simulate a wider range of possibilities (the "luck" factor).
    *   **`Win Rate Drop`**: The estimated change in your win rate (in bb/100) when moving up from the *previous* stake. Use a positive value for a drop (e.g., 1.5) and a negative value for an expected increase (e.g., -1.0). The lowest stake should have a value of 0.
    *   **`Rake (bb/100)`**: How much rake you pay at this stake. Used to calculate your rakeback profit.
    *   **Save and Sort Stakes Button**: **Always click this after making changes!** This is required for the Hysteresis (Sticky) strategy to function correctly.

    #### Tab 2: Bankroll Management Strategies
    Here you define the rules for moving up and down stakes.

    *   **Standard Strategy**:
        *   You set bankroll `thresholds`. When your bankroll is above a threshold, the corresponding rule applies.
        *   The `table mix` tells the simulator what games to play. You can use:
            *   **Fixed Ratios**: `NL20: 1`, `NL50: 3` means you play 25% of your tables at NL20 and 75% at NL50.
            *   **Percentages**: `NL100: "100%"` means you play only NL100.
            *   **Percentage Ranges**: `NL200: "20-40%"` models uncertainty in your game selection.
    *   **Hysteresis (Sticky) Strategy**:
        *   This is a "move up fast, move down slow" strategy designed to prevent you from dropping stakes during small downswings. You can set a single buy-in buffer for all stakes or check the box to define a unique buffer for each stake individually.
        *   **Moving Up**: You move up to a new stake (e.g., NL50) only when you have enough buy-ins for it (e.g., 40 BIs for NL50).
        *   **Moving Down (The "Sticky" Part)**: Once you're playing NL50, you *only* move back down to NL20 if your bankroll drops below the requirement for NL20 (e.g., 40 BIs for NL20). This creates a "buffer zone" where you stick to the higher stake.

    ---

    ### Section 3: Interpreting the Results

    This is where you see the outcome of thousands of possible poker careers.

    #### Automated Strategy Analysis
    *   This is the first section you'll see in the results. It's an AI-generated summary that gives you plain-English insights into your strategies. It will tell you which strategy was the safest, which had the most upside, and why one might have performed better than another. This analysis is also included in the PDF report.

    #### Strategy Comparison
    *   **Summary Table**: A quick overview of the most important metrics.
        *   **Median Final BR**: The 50th percentile outcome. Half the time you do better, half the time you do worse. It's a good measure of the "typical" result.
        *   **Risk of Ruin (RoR)**: Your chance of going broke according to your ruin threshold. A critical risk metric.
        *   **Target Prob**: Your chance of hitting your goal.
        *   **P95 Max Downswing**: A measure of a "worst-case" downswing. 5% of the time, you will have a downswing even bigger than this number.
    *   **Comparison Plots**:
        *   **Median Bankroll Progression**: Shows the typical journey of your bankroll over time for each strategy.
        *   **Final Bankroll Distribution**: A key plot. A tall, narrow peak means a strategy is very consistent. A short, wide curve means the strategy is higher risk/higher reward.

    #### Detailed Analysis (Per Strategy)
    This section gives you a deep dive into each strategy.

    *   **Visuals**:
        *   **Bankroll Progression**: Shows the median path (blue line), the 25th-75th percentile range (shaded area), and 50 random individual simulations (grey lines) to give you a feel for the variance.
        *   **Distribution of Assigned Luck (WR)**: This chart visualizes the "luck" factor. It shows the range of "true skill + long-term luck" the simulation assigns to different runs. The width of this curve is determined by your `Sample Hands` inputâ€”less data means more uncertainty and a wider curve.
        *   **Maximum Downswing Distribution**: Shows the full range of potential downswings. Helps you mentally prepare for the worst!
    *   **Key Insights**:
        *   **Hands Distribution**: Shows where you'll spend most of your time. The `Avg. WR` here is the average of all the "assigned luck" win rates for that stake, which is why it might differ slightly from your input.
        *   **Risk of Demotion**: The chance you'll have to move down after successfully moving up to a stake.
    *   **Percentile Win Rate Analysis**: This explains *why* some runs did well and others did poorly.
        *   **Assigned WR**: The "true" win rate (skill + long-term luck) the simulator assigned to the entire run. A high number here means this simulated "you" was on a long-term heater.
        *   **Play WR**: The actual result from playing the hands, including both the `Assigned WR` and normal session-to-session variance.
        *   **Rakeback WR**: The extra win rate you got from rakeback.
